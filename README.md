# mrec-resume

A customizable resume template in the MREC format made with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This template is a modified version of the IIIT Delhi resume template initially created by [ananyalohani](https://github.com/ananyalohani). I express my gratitude to her for developing the original template.


## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the mrec-resume template:

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/rohzzn/mrec-resume.git
cd mrec-resume
```


2. Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server. The webpage will be served at http://localhost:8080.

```
npm run serve
```


4. Edit the data in `data.yaml` with your own information.

5. Refresh your webpage to see the changes. You may need to perform a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R or ⌘⇧R) if necessary.

Feel free to customize and enhance the template to meet your specific needs as an MREC student!
